This is the project which focussed on imporvement in field of RSA. RSA is all about security which is provided by the large prime numbers it chooses what if those prime numbers are hacked by attacker.
It is difficult to hack rsa but not impossible if prime numbers are not chosen properly so that's why in MRSA or modified RSA, third party authentication is introduced.
Basic Idea of MRSA is that if if any sender eants to send message to receiver, he will send first send the request to third party authentication, third party verifies whether the request is legitimate.
If the request, sender and receiver are proved to be legitimate then the receiver sends the sender 4 bit round key or one time password, then normal RSA method is implemented.
Once cipher text is generated it is circularly rotated by 1 and Shuffled using 2D matrix.
